# Hotloader
Hate refreshing your browser every time you edit your views? Start Hotloading. 

Hate faffing with Guard, Guardfiles, GuardLiveReload, bundle exec guard blah blah blah. Something simpler? Start Hotloading.

Everytime you save a file in your rails app folder, your browser will automatically refresh. Save a view, a controller, a css component, your browser will auto refresh.

Give ActionCable time to boot on launch of server and voila.
